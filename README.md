# TalesOfVallhalla
A 2D Tile game made in Java for an University project.

Gameplay: Consists of a pseudo-campaign where the player must defeat two enemies by
surviving the necessary amount of time. While resisting the chase of the monster specific to the
level, the player might chose to collect coins in order to increase the overall walkthrough score.
Gameplay involves continuous moving in the level the hero has entered in order to survive the
chase of the two enemies he needs to face. The hero has got the option to kick his enemies in
order to avoid immediate damage, but shall think thoroughly before doing so, as he does not
have the possibility of continuously slamming his foes.
The game has got the top-down camera type and relies deeply on continuous moving and smart
path creation and selection.

Plot: The game is set in the mighty realm known to humans as Valhalla, where Vikings feast
and celebrate their battle accomplishments achieved in the normal life. It is known that only true
Vikings reach Valhalla. Ragnar, the main character of the game, has an unknown fate due to his
immoral actions done in his various raids on the Saxons.
In order to prove his might and be granted a place in Valhalla, he must defeat two extremely
powerful enemies chosen by Odin himself. He must reach the cryptic land known to humans as
Muspellheim, where he needs to face the bloodthirsty dragon Fafnir as the first challenge, while
also attempting to steal his treasure, and, then, he must face Death itself. Shall he survive, he will
be granted immediately a place in Valhalla.
